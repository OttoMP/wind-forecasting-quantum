Work subimitted to Heliyon

**Abstract:** The use of computational intelligence has become commomplace for accurate wind speed and energy forecasting,
however the energy-intensive processes involved in training and tuning stands as a critical issue for the sustainability
of AI models. Quantum computing emerges as a key player in addressing this concern, offering a quantum advantage
that could potentially accelerate computations or, more significantly, reduce energy consumption. It is a matter of
debate if purely quantum machine learning models, as they currently stand, are capable of competing with the classical
state of the art on relevant problems. We investigate the efficacy of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for wind speed
nowcasting, comparing them to Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. Utilizing meteorological data from Bahia,
Brazil, we develop a QNN tailored for one-hour-ahead wind speed prediction. Our analysis reveals that the QNN
demonstrates competitive performance and efficient parameter usage compared to MLP. We evaluate models using
RMSE, NRMSE, Pearson’s R, and Factor of 2 metrics, emphasizing QNNs’ promising generalization capabilities
and robustness across various wind prediction scenarios. This study underscores the potential of QNNs in advancing
renewable energy forecasting, advocating for further exploration of quantum machine learning in sustainable energy
research.
